ttran1

Usage:
- Press (+) button to add a new emotion.
- Long click an emotion in the emotion history list to edit emotions.

Work to be done:
- History list still needs to be ordered by Emotion date. Currently it is ordered by time of insertion into the app's memory.
- Saved emotion dates need to be editable.
- Refactor AddEmotionDialogFragment and EditEmotionDialogFragment so that they both inherit from an abstract class "EmotionDialogFragment"
- Add visual cue to indicate which list element is being edited on long click.
- Reformat the way dates are displayed so that it is more readable.
- Allow emotions to be deleted
